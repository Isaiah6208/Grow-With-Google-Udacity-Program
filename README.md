# Grow-With-Google-Udacity-Program
All of the code that I write from the Google Partnered Udacity course will be posted here for mostly an individual reminder of progression. For people curious about what I've been learning, all files are posted in order so you can personally experience my growth since starting the program.  I've included comments in the code, specifically file explanations at the top, to help quickly give context.  If i've learned something that I find valuable to mention, I'll also include it below the file explanation.
