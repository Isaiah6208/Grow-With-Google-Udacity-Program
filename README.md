# Grow-With-Google-Udacity-Program
All of the code that I write from the Google Partnered Udacity course will be posted here for mostly an individual reminder of progression. For people that are curious about what I've been learning, you can personally experience my growth since starting the program through the documentation found in each file.  I've included comments in the code, specifically file explanations at the top, to help quickly give context.  If i've learned something that I find valuable to mention, I'll also include it below the file explanation.  If it looks like fundamental topics from HTML,CSS, or JavaScript are left out, they most likely are quizzes that required me to provide snippets of code rather than full .html files for example.
